## Reference

===[ 4.3 Tar arbitrary command execution 

Previous example is nice example of file ownership hijacking. Now, let's go to even 
more interesting stuff like arbitrary command execution. Tar is very common unix program 
for creating and extracting archives.
Common usage for lets say creating archives is:

[root@defensecode public]# tar cvvf archive.tar *

So, what's the problem with 'tar'? 
Thing is that tar has many options, and among them, there some pretty interesting
options from arbitrary parameter injection point of view.

Let's check tar manual page (man tar):

      --checkpoint[=NUMBER]
              display progress messages every NUMBERth record (default 10)

       --checkpoint-action=ACTION
              execute ACTION on each checkpoint

There is '--checkpoint-action' option, that will specify program which will
be executed when checkpoint is reached. Basically, that allows us arbitrary
command execution.
